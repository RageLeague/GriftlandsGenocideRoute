[h2]How to install?[/h2]

[h3]Directly from GitHub[/h3]

With the official mod update, you can read about how to set up mods at https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/116914-early-mod-support/.

1. Find "[user]/AppData/Roaming/Klei/Griftlands/" folder on your computer, or "[user]/AppData/Roaming/Klei/Griftlands_testing/" if you're on experimental. Find the folder with all the autogenerated files, log.txt, and "saves" directory. If you are on Steam, open the folder that starts with "steam-". If you are on Epic, open the folder that contains only hexadecimal code.
2. Create a new folder called "mods" if you haven't already.
3. Clone this repository into that folder.
4. The "modinit.lua" file should be under ".../mods/[insert_repo_name_here]".
5. Volia! Now the mod should work.
